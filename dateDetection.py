# Description
# Write a regular expression that can detect dates in the DD/MM/YYYY format.
# Assume that the days range from 01 to 31, the months range from 01 to 12,
# and the years range from 1000 to 2999. Note that if the day or month is a single digit,
# itâ€™ll have a leading zero.
# 01-09, 10-19, 20-29, 30-31
